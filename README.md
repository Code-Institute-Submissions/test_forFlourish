#Flourish At Home

_Flourish At Home_ is an app designed to provide a small family run business currently selling houseplants within their local community, with the ability to assist and advise their customer base on basic plant care outside of the shop environment.

Following the sale of any plant, the owners of the shop will direct their customers towards _Flourish At Home_, highlighting the apps existence and advising the customer on the potential benefits of using the app, with the explanation that this service would be free to any customer purchasing a plant from their shop.

_Flourish At Home_ is designed with a local business in mind, offering a way for the business owner to effectively and efficiently communicate with their customer base, once they leave the shop.

Users registered on the _Flourish At Home_ app would also benefit, having access to specific information on every plant they have personally purchased from the shop, as well as advice provided by the local shop owner on how to care and place the plants for maximum enjoyment.

###User Stories

Through research conducted during the initial design of the _Flourish At Home_ app, interviews were carried out among customers who frequently visited the shop and purchased plants. This was completed in order to establish the customer base, help in the overall design of the app and decide what services and functions were offer to registered users. 

This research helped create the following user story:

>As a user of this kind of app, I want to be able to:

>>Find any plant I end up buying from the shop
>>Be able to find the plant easily - sometimes I forget the exact name of the plant, so a handy reference would be helpful
>>Be provided with relevant information about the plant - aspects about the plant I'm not aware of or would find useful, like how to look after it once I’ve purchased it
>>It's always nice getting advice from the shop owners about how to care for the plant, this would be welcome in any information provided
>>A record of when I purchased the plant
>>The ability to add my own notes on the plant
>>A clear and simple layout that provides easy access and is easy to navigation
>>To be able to keep a separate record of each plant I purchase and to have these records displayed nicely
>>To be allowed to edit the records I've added, every plant I’ve bought seems to have all these individual quirks, sometimes you can’t remember them all, so it’d be nice to have a place to store all of this information and be able to add to it when I wanted
>>To be able to delete any record, in case I no longer need it anymore
